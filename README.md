Learning Maven - Hello World Project

This is a simple project to learn how Maven works. In this project, we are using Maven to build and run a basic Java application that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

What I am learning:

-How to set up a Maven project.

-How to use Maven to build and run Java applications.

-The structure of a Maven project.
